find your favorite candidate through their platform.
Low voter turnout is a huge problem.  
Reasons for this include lack of voter enthusiasm, and a lack of understanding of the 
platforms of the candidates.  
PolitiCan gathers all candidate platforms and allows them to be searchable by the issues.  
It will allow potential voters to input their preferences with all code words/politically 
charged euphemisms and phrases stripped from them, then match them with political 
candidate's platforms.
